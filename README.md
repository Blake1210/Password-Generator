# week-3-challenge

In this challenge I created a JS file that when prompted to generate a password, you will be given several prompts to help build that password. When first prompted to build a password, one is prompted to to chose how many characters are needed. If the user picks anything less than 8 they will get a notification stating it needs to be at least 8 characters.

They will then have other prompts like if the password requires numbers, lowercase, and uppercase letters. Once filled there will be a generated password that the user could use. If the user were to select "N" for all of the prompts there will be an error message given saying that password was unable to be generated.
